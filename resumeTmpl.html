    <h1>Resume</h1>
    <p>I have been working towards a Bachelor of Computer Science degree at <a href="http://www.weber.edu/">Weber State University</a> for the past few years.</p>
    <p>I have just graduated from <a href="https://devmounta.in/">DevMountain</a> in March 2015, where I learned how to be a front end web developer. </p>
    <p>Come take a look at the website I built using the knowledge DevMountain taught me, using html, css, angular functions like ngRoute, and javascript.</p>
