    <h1>Resume</h1>
    <p>I have an Associates of Science Degree from the <a href="http://eastern.usu.edu/">College of Eastern Utah</a>, now known as USU Eastern.</p>
    <p>I have just graduated from <a href="https://devmounta.in/" target="_blank">DevMountain</a> in March 2015, where I learned how to be a front end web developer. </p>
    <p>I am currently working towards a Bachelor of Computer Science degree at <a href="http://www.weber.edu/" target="_blank">Weber State University</a> for the past few years.</p>
    <p>Come take a look at the website I built using the knowledge DevMountain taught me, using html, css, angular functions like ngRoute, and javascript.</p>
